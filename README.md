A practice project for skills I've learned

This will be a basic webpage to demonstrate things such as relative
and absolute links (I think thats what they're called) as well as
using images and learning, in general, how to "commit", whatever that
means. I'm not totally sure, or even if I'm supposed to be writing this
in this README file. I don't know.
