            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1/4 cup sesame oil</li>
                    <li>1/ cup lemon juice</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
                    <li>2 tbl brown sugar</li>
                    <li>1 tsp ground mustard</li>
                    <li>1 tsp ground ginger</li>
                    <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
                    <li>4 (6oz) salmon steaks</li>
                </ul>


                <ol>
                    <li>Mix sesame oil, lemon juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, 
                        sesame seeds, ground mustard, ginger, and garlic powder 
                        in a small saucepan over low heat. Bring to a simmer, 
                        stirring until sugar has dissolved. Set aside 1/2 cup of 
                        marinade for basting.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Pour remaining marinade into a resealable plastic bag and 
                        place salmon into the marinade. Squeeze air out of the bag, 
                        seal, and marinate the salmon steaks for at least 1 hour 
                        (2 hours for better flavor). Drain and discard used marinade.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Set oven rack about 4 inches from the heat source and preheat 
                        the oven's broiler. Place salmon steaks into a broiler pan and 
                        broil for 5 minutes. Brush steaks with reserved marinade, turn, 
                        and broil until fish is opaque and flakes easily, about 5 more 
                        minutes. Brush again with marinade.
