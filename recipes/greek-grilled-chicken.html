        <h2>The secret to this simple grilled chicken 
                is a very powerful marinade and 'roasting' 
                it slowly over semi-indirect heat on the grill</h2>
                
                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>6 Cloves minced garlic</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons dried oregano</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup lemon juice</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar</li>
                    <li>6 chicken leg quarters</li>
                    <li>1 lemon</li>
                </ul>
               
                <ol>
                    <li>Whisk garlic, oregano, red pepper flakes, black pepper,
                         lemon juice, olive oil, and vinegar together in a large bowl.</li>

                    <li>Make 2 slashes on the skin side down to the bone in the thigh 
                        section and 1 in the leg section of each leg quarter. This will 
                        help infuse pieces with marinade and allow faster cooking on 
                        the grill. Season both sides of chicken generously with kosher 
                        salt. Transfer to bowl with marinade and thoroughly coat all 
                        sides. Cover and marinate in refrigerator 4 to 12 hours. </li> 

                    <li>Transfer chicken to paper-towel-lined sheet pan to drain slightly.</li> 
                    
                    <li>Place leg quarters on grill skin side down over semi-direct heat 
                        (avoid intense direct heat so chicken cooks evenly and skin doesn't 
                        burn). Cook 6 or 7 minutes. Turn chicken and cook another 6 to 7 
                        minutes. Continue cooking and turning until internal temperature 
                        reaches 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 8 to 10 more minutes. Serve 
                        with lemon wedges.</li>
